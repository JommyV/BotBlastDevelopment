Fixes:

- Fix to the in-game menu that only worked on the second click;
- Fix to the start menu that only worked on the second click;

Menu:

- Added back button to the level selection menu.

UI:
- Increased the size of the timer and moved it lower for better visibility;
- Modified the satchel UI, it now has the satchel icons that Alex made;
- Added countdown to start of attempt.

Gameplay:
- The game now pauses 2 seconds before starting, to give the player time to adjust before starting, there is a timer counting down from 2 to 0 to inform you. If you hold down W the character moves as soon as possible. You can't walk or use satchels, but you can move the camera.



Version 0.3.0.1:
Fixes:
- Fixed being able to jump on initial freeze, I changed the logic to be more in line with the code,
- Fixed the jump logic in c++, it didn't do anything and the jump was managed by blueprints by chance. Now, if we want, we can use a variable jump to load less or more space. It's normal for now.

UI: 
- Reduced the size of the satchel UI, 

Maps: 
- Modified a level 4 platform,
- Modified some of Tara's spawn points.
